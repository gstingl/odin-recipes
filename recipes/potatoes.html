    <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! 
        A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing 
        the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker 
        or thinner. I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use 
        safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p>
